# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms

* We actively contributed to implementing the code,
* working together on scheduling algorithms and code improvements.
* This included removing redundancy and introducing a Scheduler interface to abstract shared functionality between FCFS and Preemptive Priority.
* 
* Implementing these algorithms gave me a deeper understanding of how operating systems manage process scheduling to balance efficiency,
* fairness, and responsiveness.
* also learned that no scheduling algorithm is universally optimalâ€”choices depend on system goals and workload.
* By implementing both, I better understand how modern OSs adapt scheduling strategies to different needs.
